# PikachuMemoryCard
Pikachu 2 Player is a game based on finding and matching pairs of cards in a randomly arranged deck. The object of the game is to find all the matching pairs of cards from which the score is recorded and the winner has the highest score.

Players will see a grid consisting of many cards reversed face down, arranged in rows and columns. Each card will have a distinctive Pikachu image on the back. The game begins when the player open a card, then continues to open another card to find the matching pair of cards. If two cards are the same, they are left open. But if the two cards do not match, they are reversed and the player must continue to find another pair.

The game continues until all pairs of cards are found. When the player finds all the pairs, the game ends and the score is recorded.
